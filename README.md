# Installation and Usage
### run pastebin command inside of a computer, and make sure a monitor is connected. 
on a 5x5 monitor display, the line is fairly small. However, on smaller monitors, the line may be thicker. So far, any attempt for me to change the monitor makes it all white.
```
pastebin get 5w1LbB8L LineDrawer.lua
```
then just type "LineDrawer", and click on one spot on a monitor (A), then again (B). Boom! line drawn. To clear the screen, break and replace the monitor. (very crude solution, i dont wanna code in lua ever again ._.)
Color can be manually changed by changing the hexadecimal value which can be seen here: https://computercraft.info/wiki/Colors_(API)#:~:text=bit.bnot(bCableLeft)-,Colors,-The%20following%20table
